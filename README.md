# TumorDetectionAI
This Python script uses TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate a neural network for breast cancer diagnosis. It processes a dataset (cancer.csv), splits it into training and testing sets, and defines a sequential model with three sigmoid-activated dense layers. Users can train the model or evaluate it via an interactive command-line interface.
